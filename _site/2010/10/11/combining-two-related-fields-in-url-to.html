  Usually when you select an item from a search results list you only need to pass the <span style="font-style:italic;">id</span> in the url and that's enough to lookup the rest of the details when processing the response. Recently I had a case where I couldn't lookup the item from the id because it wasn't in my database. I'm going to describe how I passed several pieces of information in a single url and what I did to ensure users could not be manipulate them independently.<br>
  <br>
  My application was searching and displaying a list of companies then keeping track of which one the user selects.<br>
  <br>
  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_36rptmL_RFc/TKsmV5B4vYI/AAAAAAAAD2A/Wf9a6OI-4kY/s1600/company_search_results.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 147px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_36rptmL_RFc/TKsmV5B4vYI/AAAAAAAAD2A/Wf9a6OI-4kY/s320/company_search_results.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524551525427887490" name="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524551525427887490"></a><br>
  <br>
  When someone clicks on a company name it would save the company's id and display a nice message "Thanks for selecting Google Inc." Since the companies came from a slow external service I didn't want to call again, I passed both the <span style="font-style:italic;">id</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> in the url.<br>
  <br>
  I built a couple of simple <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a> files to show my company list. Each row had a link to display the company name and passed both the name and id in the url.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  The controller code was also pretty straightforward.<br>
  <br>

  This worked great and worked, but then we started looking at the urls in our browser and noticed they looked like <code>http://my.site.com/companies/60902413&amp;name=Google+Inc.</code>.<br>
  <br>
  Hmm ... What would happen if someone changed the name in the url? We tried loading <code>http://my.site.com/companies/60902413&amp;name=Some+Silly+Name</code>. Uh-oh, our database now stored the selected company <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Silly Name</span> with id #60902413. This could be confusing or worse a security risk where a clever (or malicious) user could store inaccurate information in our database.<br>
  <br>
  Our solution was to combine the two fields into a single query parameter that was resistant to user tampering and is passed as a single unit. Fortunately Rails passes the session back and forth in a cookie with just that requirement. The session is a hash of many different key-value pairs that need to be encoded as a single cookie, it also contains sensitive information that should be resistant to tampering (and unreadable) and, most importantly it turns out to be something we could reuse.<br>
  <br>
  Starting from the outside in what we wanted to do was rewrite our <code>_company.html.haml</code> partial view to put the single encrypted form of the company on the url.<br>
  <br>

<p>
  and parse that in the controller
</p>

<p>
  <br>
  <br>
  Ok, but what do those <span style="font-style:italic;">to_encrypted_s</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">from_encrypted_s</span> methods do?<br>
  <br>
</p>

<p>
  I still haven't told you how they work, we're just working down from the outside-in figuring out what other classes we'll need. So what does the <span style="font-style:italic;">Encryption</span> class look like?

  We make use of the <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/MessageVerifier.html">ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier</a> class which as the documentation says "makes it easy to generate and verify messages which are signed to prevent tampering".<br>
  <br>
  Now when we select a company we get a url with a crazy long id like http://my.site.com/company/BAh7BzoJZHVuc2kDE%2BAUOhFjb21wYW55X25hbWUiMEludGVybmF0aW9uYWwgQnVzaW5lc3MgTWFjaGluZXMgQ29ycG9yYXRpb24%3D--9027b2c449c0b4a1aea375cb1722fa9db8e56066. If someone were to try and change the really long id in the url the application will throw an <span style="font-style:italic;">ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature</span> exception instead of saving bad data.<br>
  <br>
  We've given up readability in the url but in exchange we're guaranteed the id and name we get in the controller go with each other.
